# Unstable

**Unstable** is a 2D side-scrolling game that offers both **single-player** and **multiplayer** modes.

You play as a **scientist** trying to escape a **broken time machine** — one you built yourself. The machine is unstable and randomly teleports you to different time periods. Occasionally, it glitches and sends you back home, where you have a brief moment to collect **items and amulets** to help you survive — or ultimately, **repair or destroy the machine**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The main objective is to **collect all the necessary tools and notes** to fix the machine and break the **time loop**.

Along the way, you’ll encounter **amulets** that enhance your abilities:

- ⏱️ *Chronometer* – increases running speed  
- 🌿 *Plant* – enables higher jumps  
- 🍕 *Pizza* – grants a temporary double jump

> The amulet system is fully modular — adding new ones is quick and effortless.

The game ends when the player either **encounters a fatal obstacle** or successfully **repairs/destroys the machine**.

## 🌐 Multiplayer Mode

Multiplayer follows the same core gameplay as single-player, with a few key differences:

- Certain **amulets are disabled** for balance  
- The goal is to **survive as long as possible**  
- Supports an **unlimited number of players**

> Multiplayer uses **WebRTC** with a **custom signaling server**. STUN/TURN servers are free and publicly available.  
> Works over **LAN** and the **public internet**.
